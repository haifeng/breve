Privacy Policy
==============

It's simple: 

We wont share or sell your contact information to anyone. The most that anyone would know about you is what you would list in your account's [settings](/settings) page (minus your email and password)

Beyond the occasional (and very rare) announcements concerning the community in general, we wont send you an email or contact you in any way.
